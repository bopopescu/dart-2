# In order to maintain maximum test coverage for all builds,

# failed on architectures other than the one you are working on.
#
# 1) Copy the old version of the test to
#    tests/language/src/TestName[Dartc|VM|Frog]Test.dart.
#    to maintain coverage.
# 2) File a bug on each archtiecture for the failure due to the language change.
# 3) Update the language/src directory with the updated test.
